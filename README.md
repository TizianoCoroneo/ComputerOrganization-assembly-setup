A project to work with x86_64 assembly in Xcode, on a M1 machine. This project is meant to help 1st year students of CS.

## Instructions

- [Download Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (if you don't have it already)
- Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/TizianoCoroneo/ComputerOrganization-assembly-setup`
- Inside teh folder there is a `.xcodeproj` file, this is the "project file". Open it with Xcode.
- Now you have a full IDE with debugger, breakpoints and everything. 
  - Give a look around and use the Help menu to understand what all the basic buttons do. 
  - You should be already able to build and run (give a look at `main.c` and `testOperation.s`)
  - The first commit in the repo contains a working project using [Swift](https://www.swift.org) instead of C, just in case you'd like to try a new language üòÅ.
